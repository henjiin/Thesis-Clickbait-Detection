>Make a headline such that it renders the story optimally relevant for the readers

>Traditional newspaper headlines have been short, telegram like summaries

>headline and lead summarize the news text and express the semantic macro structure

## IAROVICI, AMEL
## # Def headline
> The semantic function of the headline is to inform the reader about the content or the nature of the subsequent text. The headline either represents the idea of the text or concentrates its content, indicating the sense ('direction') of reading.
>

> More often than not, the text is produced with the intention of responding to virtual expectations of a possible reader, and eventually to his implicit question. That is why we often see headlines in the form of a question: 'Is the Summit Worth the Climb?' (5/83); 'Innocent or Guilty?' (9/83); 'What's Teddy up to?' (1/79); Out-foxing Rabies?' 3/79): 'Ultrasound: Unsound?' (2/84); 'How Bad is Bigness?' (1/79); 'Hitting Below the Waste?' (4/83); etc.

> A headline formulated in the interrogative form reveals the intention not only to answer a question, but also to rouse consciences, raising a problem for discussion or revealing some dilemma.

>The headline, as a text related to another text, could be considered as a meta-text: a text referring to a text.

>The main function of the headline (or title) is to alert the reader
(receiver) to the nature or the content of the text.

# Behind the Headlines, It's a Different Story? 
## Variations in the Supply of Mass-Mediated Political Information
## Andews 2008

- Media influences people

> Headlines are a defining feature of modern mass media; a feature that different forms and
outlets of news media clearly share in common. They are especially dominant in market-oriented
media systems, in which news is viewed mainly as a commodity with the goal of profit
maximization (Hallin and Mancini 2004; McManus 1994).

>If democracy does indeed work best with equitably and
broadly informed citizens then it seems essential to carefully monitor the way politics is
portrayed by this media-generated shortcuts in the increasingly competitive market for the
public's attention.
