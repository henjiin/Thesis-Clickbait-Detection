# On newspaper headlines as relevance optimizers
## Dor 2003

> Newspaper headlines are relevance optimizers: They are designed to optimize the relevance of their stories for their readers.

> large in liiiguistic discussion, mainly in the analysis of poetic texts; inConstruction of a successful headline requires an understanding of the readers

> Make a headline such that it renders the story optimally relevant for the readers

> Traditional newspaper headlines have been short, telegram like summaries

> Headline and lead summarize the news text and express the semantic macro structure

- Headlines sometimes highlight or quote

- Tabloid headlines rarely summarize stories, rarely informative

- Tabloid headlines: trigger frames and belief systems in the readers's mind

- Lindesmanns analysis -> assumption that tabloid and quality headlines so different they cant be unified. Author thinks they can be unified under relevance theory

##Rules for headlines:

- Headlines should be clear, easy to understand, and unambiguous
- Headlines should be interesting
- Headlines should contain new information
- Headlines should not presuppose information unknown to the readers
- Headlines should include names and concepts with high 'news value' for the readers
- Headlines should not contain names and concepts with low 'news value'
- Headlines should connect
- Headlines should 'connect the story' to prior expectations and assumptions
- Headlines should 'the story in a appropriate fashion

##Tabloid newspaper:
- Cognitive effort AND new information minimized
- Maximize context of interpretation
- Low information -> many questions
- Extremely rich context of interpretation 
- Cliches
- Prejudices
- Fear
- Passion + hatred

- Nir 93: 
> for the modern newspaper reader, reading the headline of a news item replaces reading of the whole story

- Headlines are a selection device

- Newspaper readers flooded with amount of new information

- Editors assume certain readers
- Not known how good these assumptions are
- Good Entry points on how headlines should be 
- Relevance Theory is way to explain user and writer behavior
- This study is from '03, no word of the Internet, and yet it has the same concerns as modern journalists
- These days journalists have a pretty good tools to analyze users in real time

# The strategy of the headline
## IAROVICI, AMEL
- Artsy text/ essay on headlines
- Great insight on headlines in general, with a lot of examples on puns, allusions, ambiguity etc 

> The semantic function of the headline is to inform the reader about the content or the nature of the subsequent text. The headline either represents the idea of the text or concentrates its content, indicating the sense ('direction') of reading.


> More often than not, the text is produced with the intention of responding to virtual expectations of a possible reader, and eventually to his implicit question. That is why we often see headlines in the form of a question: 'Is the Summit Worth the Climb?' (5/83); 'Innocent or Guilty?' (9/83); 'What's Teddy up to?' (1/79); Out-foxing Rabies?' 3/79): 'Ultrasound: Unsound?' (2/84); 'How Bad is Bigness?' (1/79); 'Hitting Below the Waste?' (4/83); etc. 


> A headline formulated in the interrogative form reveals the intention not only to answer a question, but also to rouse consciences, raising a problem for discussion or revealing some dilemma.

>The headline, as a text related to another text, could be considered as a meta-text: a text referring to a text.

>The main function of the headline (or title) is to alert the reader
(receiver) to the nature or the content of the text.

> the strategy of the headline, which is the first message
of the text, is similar to the strategy of advertising, which is the first
message of the product offered for sale.
- 7 steps of advertising from John Caples
>(1) to attract the right audience; 
(2) to hold the audience; 
(3) to create desire; 
(4) to prove it is a bargain; 
(5) to establish confidence; 
(6) to make it easy to act; 
(7) to act at once.

> Both headline strategy and advertising strategy
focus on the intention to induce desire

- Short: A lot of typical Clickbait attribute are/ were considered outrageous by experts

- Questionnaire of 15 editors, giving 0-4 points for each bad attribute
![headline faults](images/severity-of-headline-faults.png)
- Only the worst are shown, list is longer
- Question head 18/60

- "Leading" journalists/ experts agree that the principles of Clickbait are bad

- On Editorialization (used as Opinionating)
> News headlines should not express opinions. Their job is to state facts.

On "Doesn't tell the story"
> ... a news headline that doesn't tell the story doesn't do its main job

> The worst kind of head that doesn't tell the story is the kind that says the opposite of what the story says.

On screamers(All caps giant headlines)
> Thus, the poor reader, seeing a screamer every day, loses either his news perspective or his faith in the paper's news judgment.

> The economic urge for street sales breeds bastard banners, newsworthy only for the emotionally undernourished fan clubs of intellectually underprivileged  gossip columnists

- No examples that are like Clickbait
- It seems like CB came from womens magazines
- In news not recognized until much later

- Questions in headlines are bad
> A head that asks a question is speculation, not news.

OF TABLOID HEADLINESE
## Lindemann 1990
- Paper on tabloid news headlines
- Cited headlines aren't Clickbait
- Tabloid headlines don't accomplish their task


> Tabloid headlines [..] rather disinform, puzzle their readers by means of a highly repetitive formulation of an often cryptic message?

> Indeed, one of the most striking features of tabloid headlinese is
the introductory doublet, the fact that the news announced in the
headline is immediately repeated by a more fully worded sub-
heading or intro.

# Newspaper headlines and relevance: Ad hoc concepts in ad hoc contexts
## Elly Ifantidou

- function of headlines
> (a) summarize and 
(b) attract attention to the full-text newspaper article.

> In the above cases, it was concluded that headlines make a loose,
inadequate or misleading substitute for full-text news reports in a number of ways: by directing the reader’s attention to
an aspect of the story, by highlighting the topic in a non-objective, yet intriguing way, by oversimplifying the full-text
content, while consistently masking other ‘relevant’ information. Precisely because headlines consistently
underrepresent, or overrepresent, and hence misrepresent, news stories, readers’ previous knowledge and
sophisticated reading strategies are claimed to be critical in retrieving the explicit or implicit meaning conveyed
(León, 1997:101–102; Althaus et al., 2001:715).


>Statistical analysis showed that readers are interested in the type of information conveyed by means of headlines, in the sense that readers wish headlines to address ‘familiar’ topics which relate to their ‘background knowledge’ and to their ‘interests’ in specific domains, albeit not necessarily by means of fully-informative headlines.
